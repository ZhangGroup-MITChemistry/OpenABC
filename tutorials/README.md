# Tutorials

This folder provides tutorials for setting up and performing simulations with MOFF, MRG or HPS models. Each tutorial includes jupyter notebooks and necessary input files. 

- MOFF-protein-condensate explains 
    1. setting simulations of a protein with both folded and disordered domains using MOFF; 
    2. setting up condensate simulations with MOFF; 
    3. converting coarse-grained configurations with only alpha carbons to atomistic structures;
    4. analyzing slab simulation trajectories to compute density profiles. 

- HPS-protein-condensate explains
    1. setting up simulations of a single protein with HPS;
    2. setting up condensate simulations with HPS. 

- MOFF-protein-MRG-dsDNA-condensate explains setting up complex condensate simulations with MOFF and MRG-DNA.

- MRG-dsDNA provides an example for runing simulations of a dsDNA with MRG.
